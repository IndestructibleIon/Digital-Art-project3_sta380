<h1>
   You've Found Something Tangible

<h2>
  The "Highlights" Are As Above And So Below
</h2>

<p> Well allthings must inevitably end at some point and this will be the end of the road for your journey.
  I'm so glad you've made it this far. Sifting through deception and trickery, memes and maybe even a lesson
  or two. I'm tired. Of many many things. The value of myself. The value of my artwork. The value of my values.
  All of it is called into question generally by forces not under our control, not under my control certainly.
</p>

<p> However it is only when art is seen by others do we have a chance of udnerstanding our impact on the world.
  How far have we come since the beginning to influence people. What was your goal? Did you intend to change
  the way people see you? Did you intend to change the world? Did you settle for less than you could have and
  stuck with something safe guaranteed to get you into a museum and some portion of recognition? Did I not go
  far enough to shock people, to frustrate them? I want to make people think about digital art as more than just
  pixels, coded in 1's and 0's. I value the art online. I value the people who sit in their basements, offices,
  bedrooms, and cafes. I believe that if I put value into this idea then maybe others will see that and recognize
  the same concepts in it that I do. I'm cynical, but still hopeful that one day we'll be on equal footing with
  other mediums and finally hold the same value that we see in our work. I'd like to hear what you think so email me
</p>

<p>
  I'd like to hear what you think so go to that strange blog you found on your trip here and maybe let me know.
  Feedback is critical to moving forward in a process based on a new technology that fails on occassion.
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for your time. I'll be seein' ya.
