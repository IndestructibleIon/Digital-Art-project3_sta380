  What Can I Say?
  </h1>

  <h2>
  This. is. a. <a href="page3.html"><strong>RIOT!</strong></a>
  </h2>

<p> I gotta be honest with you if I knew I could make art that can be everywhere at once,
  free for everyone to see, and have complete control over it... I might've been a cave
  dwelling troll a long time ago.
</p>

  <p>Take this background for example, A lovely spiral gradient overlapped
  with other linear gradients to create a nice easy semi transparent background. Took me two minutes which
  blows the gradients I'd paint with out of the water with how easy they are to make and
  how smooth they've become since the early days of photoshop.
</p>

  <button type="button" onclick="alert('Nope not here')"
  style="background-color: darkgrey; border-color: navy">
  There's more buttons.
  </button>

  <button type="button" onclick="alert('NOT HERE EITHER! HAHA!')"
  style="background-color: red; border-color: slategray;">
  HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?
  </button>

<p> I know what you're going to say. "You tricked me! There was nothing but british lies and self
  promotion on that first page!" Well I don't like holding back and I certainly didn't take all this time and
  effort to learn shitloads of html and CSS just to give up the ghost. So be sure to look around!
  A RIOT of a good time is still to be had.... hint.
