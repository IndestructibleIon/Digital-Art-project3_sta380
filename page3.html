<h1>
  One Way Out
</h1>

  <p>
    Alright. I'm done. No more. No more typing. No more coding.
  </p>

  <p>
  It feels almost theraputic to be done with a project that takes so much work to complete. It's comprable to sculpting a
  statue out of marble or a mural. The feeling of relaxing and peace finally achieved after what feels like ages.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lies stop here, there won't be any more. I can gurantee it! (Easy since I'm the one that made all you see before you)
    So go forth! Claim the final prize and envelop yourself in the satisfaction awarded and so greedily taken!
